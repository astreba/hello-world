This will be a repository that will include place where you store ideas, resources, and shared discussions. 
My name is Alicia Treba, I am from Northwest Indiana. Currently I work as a phlebotomist at Community Hospital and at home I have 2 dogs and 1 cat. My partner and I just recently purchased our first home and him and I have been making small renovations since then.
